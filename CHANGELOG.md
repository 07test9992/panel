# Changelog
This file is a running track of new features and fixes to each version of the panel released starting with `v0.4.0`.

## v0.4.0 (release scheduled ~ Mid September)
Requires `Daemon@0.2.0`

### New Features
* Task scheduler supporting customized CRON syntax or dropdown selected options. (currently only support command and power options)
* Adds support for changing per-server database passwords from the panel.
* Allows for use of IP rather than a FQDN if the node is not using SSL
* Adds support for IP Aliases on display pages for users. This makes it possible to use GRE tunnels and still show the user what IP they should be connecting to.
* Adds support for suspending servers
* Adds support for viewing SFTP password within the panel ([#74](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/74), thanks [@ET-Bent](https://github.com/ET-Bent))
* Improved API with support for server suspension and build modification.
* Improved service managment and setup on first install.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes password auto-generation on 'Manage Server' page. ([#67](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/67), thanks [@ET-Bent](https://github.com/ET-Bent))
* Fixes some overly verbose user output when an error occurs
* **[Security Patch]** Fixes listing of server variables for server. Previously a bug made it possible to view settings for all servers, even if the user didn't own that server. ([#69](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/69))
* Prevent calling daemon until database call has been confirmed when changing default connection.
* Fixes a few display issues relating to subusers and database management.

* Fixes bug where files could not be uploaded through the "click and select" system, only through "drag and drop." ([#82](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/83), thanks [@xX1bumblebee1Xx](https://github.com/xX1bumblebee1Xx))
* Fixes a bug where new files could not be created through the panel for a server. ([#85](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/85), thanks [@xX1bumblebee1Xx](https://github.com/xX1bumblebee1Xx))
* Fixes the exception handler to properly display and log exceptions that might occur rather than leaving a vague error. ([#81](https://github.com/Pterodactyl/Panel/issues/83))

### General
